ABOUTWe don’t build web pages -- we help you make a statement.I am a web developer, but that is over-simplified. I come to work every day because I want to solve the biggest problem of making everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.Learning Makes Me Happy!I have a passion for knowledge, because the moment you’re not learning I believe you’re dead. Help me learn about your passion! I’m excited to start learning about you—your organization—and make something meaningful together with you.MotivatedMy drive and ambition come for a deeply rooted commitment to excellence and dedication born of my time as a member of the U.S. Army’s 75th Ranger Regiment. Jargon-free ZoneI know—no industry jargon?! Yup!There’s no sense in trying to go out of our way to sound super smart. Those that do, often aren’t. After all, if you don’t understand what we’re talking, how will you know if I can help you? Like most, I appreciate straight talk about what you do and the statement you want to make. Let me help!Besides, in today’s business it isn’t so much about what you know as much as it is if you know how to find it out.Start with Why!I truly believe in the power of knowledge and the goal of simplifying communication.The history of business revolves around the fact that people use data to make more informed decisions. If that data is cumbersome to access, difficult to understand, or impractical to apply it is of little value. “Difficult” data makes for difficult business.
